Project Overview:
The dataset includes details about 39,717 bank customers, and the analysis focuses on using various KPIs to evaluate customer behavior. The project explores verified vs. non-verified customers by year, interest rates, and the influence of payment modes on loan performance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Year-wise Loan Amount Statistics
Grade and Sub-grade wise Revolving Balance
Total Payments: Verified vs. Non-verified Status
State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status
Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date Statistics
Key Insights:
Loan Amount Trends: The loan amounts have steadily increased year-over-year, indicating a growing demand for credit. This suggests that borrowers are increasingly seeking financing for diverse needs.
Charged-Off Loans: The "Charged Off" category highlights a significant number of loans that were declared as losses, reflecting potential risks in the lending process.
Verification's Impact: The data reveals that verification status plays a crucial role in driving higher payment volumes, which can enhance trust and security in financial transactions.
Last Payment Date Analysis: Evaluating the last payment date provides insight into payment timeliness, helping to identify repayment patterns across different homeownership categories.
